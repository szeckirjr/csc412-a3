The SVM[1] in linguistics is a mapping of the structure of linguistic knowledge in a graphic form using the colour of visual objects to encode the most common patterns. The models thus obtained replace the textual explanations (rules) in the formation of the corresponding skills.
For the application of the SVM in linguistics, it is proposed to encode information on the method of constructing an English sentence using spatial placement and the form of visual objects, and about temporal forms and related senses-using spatial placement and colour.
