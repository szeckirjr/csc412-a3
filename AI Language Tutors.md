Recently, there has been a surge in a whole new technology related to language - Large Language Models (LLMs). These models, which are trained and ran based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms, simulate how humans organize and structure language, with the capability to interpret, predict, and generate text [1]. This new technology is more than just a new computational feat, as it is also a leap towards understanding the human cognitive process itself, especially in the context of language acquisition [2].

## Bridging Cognitive Understanding
LLM's ability to mimic human language processing opens a window into the realm of cognitive science. The goal of leveraging these models as "cognitive models" is **not** to mirror human cognition in every aspect, but rather to provide an accessibly system with some clearly defined mapping to the target, similar to how most models are employed across various scientific domains [2].

Despite the large differences in scale, architecture, and training objectives between LLMs and humans, LLMs when utilized as cognitive models do exhibit immense promise in enhancing our comprehension of human cognition [2]. They provide a platform to study data-driven learning, particularly when it comes to [[Language Acquisition]], a complex yet fundamental and natural aspect of human learning. The insights gotten from these models could establish critical baselines for describing language learning and other domains like physical reasoning.

In this way, LLMs have a good potential of serving as tools for computational cognitive augmentation, helping in the unraveling of the complex mix between language, reasoning, and other uniquely human behaviours.
## LLMs and Language Learning
In practice, LLMs have shown promise in assisting language learning. They can be used not only to highlight important phrases and generate summaries and translations given a piece of text, but also provide grammar and vocabulary explanations, suggest improvements, and assist in conversation practice [3]. All these capabilities pave the way for AI Language Tutors that can provide personalized and adaptive learning experiences, and they help with overcoming the barriers associated with traditional language learning methods.

Generate AI chatbots that are empowered by LLMs are quickly emerging as an education tool and as potential language tutors. Duolingo, for example, as outlined in [[Language Learning Apps]], released a new version of the app that allows for interactive and engaging learning environments, providing real-time feedback and personalized tutoring based on the learner's proficiency and overall goals [4]. With how flexible and adaptable these models are, they cater to a wide range of learners, making [[Language Acquisition]] more accessible and enjoyable.
## LLMs and Inclusivity
The integration of LLMs in a variety of language-related tools, such as Language Learning, presents significant progress towards fostering [[Computing Systems for Language Acquisition and Inclusion]]. Not only can they be used for [[Language Acquisition]] and create a more inclusive community that breaks down language and cultural biases, but they can also be used as an [[Assistive Technology]].

LLMs can power sophisticated speech recognition and generation systems, aiding individuals with hearing or speech impairments. They enable real-time translation and transcription services, which make interactions across different languages seamless. In education, LLMs also contribute to a more inclusive environment by offering personalized and adaptive experiences, catering to a user's special needs and preferences. By transcending linguistic barriers and catering to a variety of needs, these models are critical in creating more linguistic inclusivity and social cohesion.
## Important Factors
It is important to finish this section by realizing that the journey towards fully realizing the potential of AI Language Tutors is filled with challenges, especially when it comes to data privacy, managing quality and bias in generated responses, and assessing effectiveness compared to human tutors. On the other hand, these are new technologies and continuous advancements in LLMs/AI creates a promising future where language learning is more interactive, personalized, and globally accessible. Through their potential in computation cognitive augmentation and as assistive technologies, they are a good example on the profound impact of technological innovation on [[Language Acquisition]] and inclusion.
