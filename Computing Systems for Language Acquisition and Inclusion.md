Language is arguably the cornerstone of human civilization, a tool that cultures develop to allow members of a community to interact. It serves as the foundation for communication, allowing for expression and comprehension amongst people, acting as a bridge to connect diverse cultures and communities. Not only that, but language also shapes our thought processes, as it is usually through language that we categorize, analyze, and interpret the world around us.

However, the ability to acquire or communicate through language can sometimes be a hurdle for many, due to various barriers such as speech impairments, hearing challenges, or simply the daunting curve of learning a new language.

In a globalized world, the ability to communicate across linguistic boundaries is more important than ever. Computing technology has led to the evolution of various systems that aim to augment [[Language Acquisition]] and foster inclusivity, breaking down the barriers that impede communication and understanding.

This wiki will dive into existing systems that seek to enhance the process of language learning and ensure linguistic inclusion. It will focus on two primary subtopics: [[Language Acquisition]] and [[Assistive Technology]]. 

The [[Language Acquisition]] section will explore systems designed to help people learn a new language. One popular system that is studied is [[Language Learning Apps]], along with two techniques typically employed by these apps, [[Spaced Repetition System]] and [[Gamification of Language Learning]]. 

The [[Assistive Technology]] section addressees technologies that bridges the gap for individuals facing challenges in verbal or written communication. In this subtopic, the wiki delves into [[Translation Technologies]] and 2 of its variants, [[Speech-to-Text]] and [[Text-to-Speech]]. Additionally [[Methods along with computing systems that could better the communication between different-language speakers]] will be explored. 

Each section is dedicated to unraveling the fascinating mix between language and technology, and how this blend is fortifying a global community where the exchange of ideas, cultures, and knowledge thrives unrestricted.
